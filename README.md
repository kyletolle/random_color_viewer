# random_color_viewer

A way to view random colors that are generated each time someone visits the
homepage

Uses [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/), [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy),
and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).

See a demo at https://random-color-viewer.deno.dev/.

## Creating the Repo

Once GitPod is up and running, you can install Fresh with

```
deno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev .
```

## Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
